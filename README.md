## How to play
The mechanics are very simple. You turn rooster collecting on, and let the program sitting in the background. It will start collecting roosters, and everytime it finds one you will get notified. You can collect your roosters, free them, or rename them. Each rooster has its level.

## Advanced stuff
If you want to dig deeper, you can find a file called "data.json" inside the "assets" folder, on the game's root. It will contain an array of every rooster and its level and name. It also stores whether the user has seen the intro or not. Be careful not to delete or make the file invalid, or the game will fail to open.
